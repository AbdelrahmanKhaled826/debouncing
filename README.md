# debouncing

When we press a pushbutton or toggle switch or a micro switch, two metal parts come into contact to short the supply. But they donâ€™t connect instantly but the metal parts connect and disconnect several times before the actual stable connection is made. The same thing happens while releasing the button. This results the false triggering or multiple triggering like the button is pressed multiple times. Its like falling a bouncing ball from a height and it keeps bouncing on the surface
